            Hi my name is Andrew Nilsson, I am 23 years old, born and raised in Ripon. I have 3 brothers, 3 nephews, and
            1 niece. I don't have any pets because sadly my mom isnt a fan of them, but I hope to get a dog one day when
            I live alone. Before Codestack, I was going to San Fransico State University for 5 years. I took some
            computer programming classes, but none compared to how quick and easy it is to learn all this at CodeStack.
            My favorite things to do are playing videogames, eating and sleeping. My favorite foods are cheeseburgers,
            pizza, Itz Itz and legit everything else. After I finish with CodeStack I hope to become a backend
            developer, and possibly make a game.
